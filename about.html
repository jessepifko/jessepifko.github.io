									<h1>About Me</h1>

									<h2>Bio</h2>
								<p>
										I grew up in a suburb of Detroit called Warren. My childhood was spent running around 
										outside with the neighborhood boys, learning about computers, and playing video games. 
										I attended high school at Center Line High in Center Line, Michigan. My fondest memories 
										of high school were in the computer science labs working on projects for my teacher. It 
										was here where I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, & Javascript.
										<br><br>
										Due to my family situation at home, I was forced to get a job in highschool to help out. 
										My first job was as a dish washer in a catering hall on the weekends. My junior year I got
										 a job as an assistant butcher where I learned how to prep the meat counters and clean the
										  equipment. Senior year I got referred by a friend to start working in Construction. I quickly
										   learned that I did not want to spend my career breaking my back and decided to go to college.
										<br><br>
										I started out attending night school at Baker College while continuing to work my construction job. 
										After feeling like I wasn't getting everything I wanted out of college, I decided to transfer to 
										Central Michigan University where I knew a few people attending. At Central Michigan I quickly learned that 
										the community there was a world of its own. During the start of my time here, I spent many hours on campus getting 
										involved in university politics and the start up scene through the College of Business and Entrepeneurship. 
										It was during this time I learned a ton about start ups, business development, and myself. Although I graduated with 
										a degree in Communications, I very much felt like I got an education in business leadership and entrepeneurship.
