									<div>I grew up in a suburb of Detroit called Warren. My childhood was spent running around outside with the neighborhood boys, learning about computers, and playing video games. I attended high school at Center Line High in Center Line, Michigan where I played football and worked inside the computer science lab during my free time. While working under the supervision of my teacher, I built an art gallery for the school's Art Department using HTML, CSS & Javascript.</div>
									<br>
									<div>I'm a first-generation college student and started my academic career attending Baker College's night school so I could work during the day. I later transferred to Central Michigan University where I continued to work part-time to pay for school. After graduating with a degree in Communications, I spent a few years in different sales environments selling gym memberships, consumer electronics, and used vehicles. <br>
										<br>In the midst of a searching for something new to experience, I decided to return to my love for computers, which is what brought me to Grand Circus. Starting in April of 2020, I dedicated myself to learn the principles and foundations of building software using C# and the .NET framework. 
										<br><br>
										Currently, I am learning JavaScript with the goal of being able to develop dynamic web apps. My ideal position would be a full stack position with built-in support systems to nurture my growth.  </div>
