									<h1>About Me</h1>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<h2>Bio</h2>
								<p>
									I grew up in a suburb of Detroit called Warren. 
									My childhood was spent running around outside with the neighborhood boys, learning about 
									computers, and playing video games. I attended high school at Center Line High in Center Line,
									 Michigan where I played football. Some of my fondest memories of high school were either on 
									 the football field or the computer science labs. It was here where I learned how to build 
									 websites from the ground up using HTML and CSS. 
 									<br><br>
									My first high school job was as a dishwasher in a catering hall on the weekends. Junior year 
									I got a job as an assistant butcher where I learned how to prep the meat counters and how to 
									use the machines. After graduation, I started out attending night school at Baker College while
									working during the day. This time was especially challenging and was exhausting, especially after
									 a long day. But I persevered and after a year, I decided to transfer to University. 
									 At university, I got involved in student affairs and business plan competitions through 
									 the College of Business and Entrepreneurship. 
									 <br><br>
									After graduation, I spent a few years in sales in different capacities selling gym
									 memberships, consumer electronics, and used vehicles. Sales was a means to an end while 
									 discovering my real passion.  I found Grand Circus in the midst of that search and decided 
									 to jump in feet first. Starting in April of 2020, I 
									 dedicated myself to learn the principles and foundations of building software using C# and 
									 the .NET framework. I have spent roughly 60 hours per week throughout the 12 weeks working on 
									 homework and assigned projects. I could not be more proud of myself for passing 
									 and cannot wait to start out as a junior developer in the industry. <br><br>
