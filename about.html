									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<div>I grew up in a suburb of Detroit called Warren. My childhood was spent running around outside with the neighborhood boys, learning about computers, and playing video games. I attended high school at Center Line High in Center Line, Michigan where I played football and worked inside the computer science lab during my free time. While working under the supervision of my teacher, I built an art gallery by hand for the school's Art Department using HTML, CSS & Javascript.</div>
									<br>
									<div>I'm a first-generation college student and am no stranger to working long hours with school.  I started attending Baker College's night school so I could work during the day and later transferred  Central Michigan where I continued to work part-time. College was especially difficult because everything was so new and was without a support system, but I still persevered. </div>
									<br>
									<div>After graduating with a degree in Communications, I spent a few years in sales in different capacities selling gym memberships, consumer electronics, and used vehicles. Sales was a means to an end while rediscovering my true passion: coding.  I found Grand Circus in the midst of that search and decided to jump in feet first. Starting in April of 2020, I dedicated myself to learn the principles and foundations of building software using C# and the .NET framework. I have put in 60-70 hour work weeks throughout the bootcamp working on homework and assigned projects outside of GC's full-time schedule.
										<br><br>
										I'm a technical person by nature and am looking for a position where I can both develop and grow in. </div>
